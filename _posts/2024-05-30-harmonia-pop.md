## **ðŸŽ¸ Introduction: The Hidden Power of Three Chords**  
*By Lamartine guitar*  

As a guitarist, Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by how songs like *"Let It Be"* or *"Stand By Me"* can feel so timeless. The secret? Three chords that rule pop music: the **tonic (I)**, **subdominant (IV)**, and **dominant (V)**. Letâ€™s break them down **with guitar-friendly examples**!

## **ðŸŽ¶ Harmonic Functions Explained (For Guitarists)**  
Hereâ€™s how I explain these concepts to my students:  

| Chord       | Roman Numeral | "Guitar Mood"       | Example in **G Major** |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| **Tonic (I)**    | G             | "Home" â€“ Relaxed    | ðŸŽ¸ G chord (320003)    |
| **Subdominant (IV)** | C         | "Adventure" â€“ Warm  | ðŸŽ¸ C chord (x32010)    |
| **Dominant (V)** | D             | "Suspense!" â€“ Energetic | ðŸŽ¸ D chord (xx0232) |

> ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip**: Try playing **G â†’ C â†’ D â†’ G** on your guitar. Hear how it tells a mini-story?

## **ðŸ”¥ Pop Song Examples (With Guitar Tabs)**  
### **1. Classic: I â€“ V â€“ IV â€“ I**  
- **Song**: *"Stand By Me"* (Ben E. King)  
  **Chords**: G (I) â†’ D (V) â†’ C (IV) â†’ G (I)  
  **Guitar Tab**:
G: 320003
D: xx0232
C: x32010

### **2. Emotional: I â€“ vi â€“ IV â€“ V**  
- **Song**: *"All of Me"* (John Legend) â€“ *Key: Eb (use capo 1 for guitar!)*  
**Chords**: Eb (I) â†’ Cm (vi) â†’ Ab (IV) â†’ Bb (V)  
**Simplified for Guitar (Capo 1)**:  
D (I): xx0232
Bm (vi): x24432
G (IV): 320003
A (V): x02220

## **ðŸ¤” Why Do These Progressions Work?**  
- **The "Guitar Neck" Logic**: Notice how **I, IV, V** in G major (G, C, D) all use open strings? Thatâ€™s why they sound full and resonant!  
- **Dominantâ€™s Magic**: The **V chord (D)** contains the note **F#**, which *craves* resolution to Gâ€™s root note.

## **ðŸŽ¯ Challenge for Guitarists**  
1. **Play**: Try the *"Stand By Me"* progression above.  
2. **Compose**: Make your own 4-chord loop using **I, IV, V**. Record it and tag me on social media!  (my instagram @lamartineguitar)
